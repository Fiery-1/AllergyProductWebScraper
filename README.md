# Allergen Product Webscraper  

A Python web scraper that identifies allergen-safe products based on a given list of allergies. This tool helps users filter out products that may contain allergens by scraping sites like **boots.com**. Future plans include integrating a web frontend to make it accessible for a wider audience.
